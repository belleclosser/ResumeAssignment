        <h2 class="headline">Graduating in December with my A.A.S. degree in Advertising & Graphic Design. Adobe fan</h2>

        <p>I am a first-generation college student. I will use my degree in Advertising and Graphic Design to design as I travel the world and gather influence from different places and people. The flexibility of digital work allows me to have a diverse perspective and expand my knowledge, which in turn strengthens my advertising and graphic design work. I am inspired to create based on what I observe in real life. My design work effectively communicates in an impactful way.</p>
